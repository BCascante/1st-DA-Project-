# Data Quality Practice - E-commerce Dataset ðŸ›’

This repository contains my first practice project as a Data Analyst, focusing on improving the quality of an e-commerce customer dataset. 

## Project Overview
In this project, I performed basic data cleaning and type conversions to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. Key tasks include:
- Converting `user_id` from string to integer.
- Removing unnecessary spaces and special characters in `user_name`.
- Converting `user_age` from float to integer.
- Standardizing `favorite_categories` to lowercase for consistency.

## Tools Used
- Python

This is part of my learning journey as a Junior Data Analyst. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
